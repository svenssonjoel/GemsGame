* GemsGame 
  A Gemstacking game as an exercise in wxHaskell. 

* About the Gems graphics
  The gem png files comes from a package available at the following site

* Notes
  + how to listen for spacebar ?
    on (charKey ' ') := .. does not seem to do it. 
* TODOs 
  + GemClusters of different orientation.
  + GemClusters with random gems.
  + Check for "Lost game". 
  + Done: Before moving cluster left or right, check if that is allowed. 
  + Keep Score.
  + Animate removal of gems (in some way). 
  + MarkForDeletion and DeleteMarked should be performed until the game area
    is unchanged between iterations.
